--> Flask API – A Friendly Guide

 
This is FlaskAPI App that can keep track of people, remember their names, update them if they change, and even forget them if needed.

If you’ve ever wanted to make your computer say:  
> “Sure thing! I’ve added Alice to the list.”  
or  
> “Okay, Bob is gone now…”  

you can just type it out
